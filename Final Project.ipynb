    "### Background:\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the year 2000, the domestic economy in the United States has experienced many ups and\n",
    "downs. Historically, people have been forced to become more innovative to improve their quality of life in\n",
    "times of scarcity, such as during the Great Depression or the 2008 recession. In that regard, we hypothesize\n",
    "that people who watch movies in theaters when the economy is not doing well will be looking for an escape\n",
    "from their daily lives and therefore give movies better ratings than in other years. In addition, we might find\n",
    "a correlation with box office values with median household incomes. We hypothesize that box office values\n",
    "will be negatively correlated with median household incomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, we hypothesized that during years when the economy is bad and household incomes are\n",
    "lower than usual, moviegoers will rate movies being played in theaters higher than in other years. However,\n",
    "we can take this hypothesis a step further by also asking whether moviegoers will prefer to see specific\n",
    "genres of movies during years when household incomes are low in comparison to genres preferred in years\n",
    "when household incomes are higher. During economic falls, individuals usually will have a lower household\n",
    "median income for their expenses and leisure activities. During such times individuals tend to spend less\n",
    "money on leisure activities, such as going to the theaters. We assume that individuals will be more selective\n",
    "with the movies they watch during economic troubles. This claim is an unsupported one and possibly\n",
    "biased.\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of our project is finding trends in ratings and box office earnings of movies and movie\n",
    "genres. Therefore, we need data with information about household incomes; this would be easiest to\n",
    "accomplish with data from the United States using the US Census Bureau. We also need to collect\n",
    "information about genres of movies and box office revenues of movies in and the year they aired."
